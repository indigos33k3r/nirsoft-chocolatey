# nirsoft-chocolatey
[Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org) packages for selected [NirSoft](http://www.nirsoft.net) utilities. **I'm not associated with NirSoft**, just like some of the stuff.

The packages are all (submitted to be/eventually) published to the main chocolatey feed.

(Mind you these are pretty trivial scripts...)
